/**
 * The template for displaying the site footer
 *
 * This theme, out of the box, references the correspondingly named html file
 * in the parts folder. The header and footer files are exceptions based on
 * the challenges that we unearthed that led us to this theme structure. These
 * Files are php-based out of the box but can be modified to leverage template
 * parts if desired. If, for the purposes of your current build, it necessitates
 * managing your footer in a template part rather than php, you can delete any
 * unnecessary php references below and add the following snippet of code.
 *
 * @example block_template_part( 'footer' );
 *
